	Remove all guns (and grenades) in pawn generation process AND remove all mechanoids and spacers factions AND makes resting factions to not siege you (can't find another way for removing mortars) - You still have to use scenario options if you want to completely remove mechanoids events(poisonship and psychicship) and colonists starting guns
